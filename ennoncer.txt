Description
Ohhhh nooo!! IMDB just went down. Luckily we heard that you could help to provide a service while IMDB's DevOps team gets the website back online.

You will create a backend API to allow a user to search for a movie search by genre. What is a backend? What is an API? These two questions might require some googling to grasp the concepts before starting the project. :-)

We will provide you with a CSV file. This file contains more than one thousand movie titles. One of the columns marks the genre for each movie.

Your backend will receive a requested genre and will only serve movies with the corresponding genre. Example: The client requests all Action movies. Your backend should parse the CSV, filter by the genre `Action and reply with a list of Action movies, while also respecting the HTTP protocol.

For this project you will be able to use a framework to take care of the HTTP communication protocol.

Technical Description
Create a backend app with a light web framework. (For python we recommend using flask.) It will listen on port 8080.

All your routes will answer in JSON format!

You don't need to create a database, just parse the provided CSV.

Your backend will serve nine routes examples below:

GET on / This route will parse the GET parameter genre, to be able to filter by movie genre.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080?genre=action"
GET on /action This route will only serve action movies.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080/action"
GET on /adventure This route will only serve adventure movies.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080/adventure"
GET on /comedy This route will only serve comedy movies.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080/comedy"
GET on /drama This route will only serve drama movies.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080/drama"
GET on /romance This route will only serve romance movies.
Example on how to access this route:

curl "http://localhost:8080/romance"
Example:

[my_imdb_api/]curl "localhost:8080?genre=western"

How can I access my docode server from the browser?
1 -- Open your server Make your server listening on 0.0.0.0 And make sure the listening port is 8080

2 -- Your server will be accessible at this URL: XXXXXXXXX is your docode ID http://web-XXXXXXXXX.docode.YYYY.qwasar.io

Example:

If your docode url is:
abc123.docode.us.qwasar.io
then your url will be:
http://abc123.docode.us.qwasar.io
